What I learnt (and you can learn) by building this project include but not limited to the following:
- Simple approach to using [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) (w/ ChangeNotifier) for managing app state
- Working with REST APIs using [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) package
- Using [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) to access service objects
